# I make websites and whatnot
I’ve been making things on the internet for most of my life, and websites are a huge part of that. I aim to support as many browsers as possible with my work, particularly four old Nintendo browsers<sup>[[DS](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Browser)][[DSi](http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_DSi_Browser)][[Wii](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Internet_Channel)][[3DS](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Internet_Browser)]</sup>. The capabilities of these browsers are [barely documented at best](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13802) (at least today), and almost no one tries to support them. Millions still have access to these, so why not make browsing the web fun again?

I will do anything to get a faster [FCP](http://web.dev/articles/fcp) and save a byte. I’ve always been disappointed with how many websites cram the [DOM](http://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) and don’t respect if the user has a data limit, lives in the middle of nowhere, or has places to be. The least I can do is point others in the right direction.

Aside from hobbyist web development, I like to make small contributions to various projects I find interesting. This is why I have dozens of forks; I recommend checking my pins or activity to see what I’m actually up to. The most notable thing I’ve contributed is [the Return YouTube Dislike logo](http://github.com/Anarios/return-youtube-dislike/commit/6994dc0e42533c31cc69efef6119d1a206cff27c) — you don’t need to be a programmer to make an impact!

My goals for ~~2024~~ 2025 are to learn full stack web development, game design and [Geometry Dash modding](http://geode-sdk.org).

Maybe check out [my so-called “cool website”](http://nightcat.gg)? I heard it’s “[responsive](http://bestmotherfucking.website)”.
