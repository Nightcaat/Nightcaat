# I make websites.
## And sometimes games.
I have been making things on the internet for most of my life, and websites are a huge part of it. I aim to support as many browsers as possible with my work, particularly [Nint](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Browser)[endo](http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_DSi_Browser) [brow](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Internet_Channel)[sers](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Internet_Browser) and [Internet Explorer](http://files.catbox.moe/lu4zu6.jpg), as even people with old-looking websites tend not to put this much attention to detail in; many of said websites even require [TLS](http://wikipedia.org/Transport_Layer_Security) to visit them, which prevents most vintage browsers from loading them at all. I do my best to help fix this so those who wish to experience the internet how it was back in the day still can.

So what have I done anyway?
* Made a [personal website](http://nightcat.gg), [mkwii.guide](http://mkwii.guide), and [flipnote.studio](http://flipnote.studio) among others
* Helped several people make, set up and design their websites
* Improved the frontend and joined the dev team of [Mario Royale Deluxe](http://marioroyale.com)
* Many incomplete game prototypes (hope to change this soon)
* Small contributions to various projects I find interesting
* Something else I definitely missed

Thanks for checking me out and have a great day :)
