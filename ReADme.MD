# I make websites and whatnot
I’ve been making things on the internet for most of my life, and websites are a huge part of it. I aim to support as many browsers as possible with my work, particularly [Nint](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Browser)[endo](http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_DSi_Browser) [brow](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Internet_Channel)[sers](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Internet_Browser) and [Internet Explorer](http://files.catbox.moe/lu4zu6.jpg), as even people with old-looking websites tend not to put this much attention to detail in; many of said websites even require [TLS](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) to visit them, which prevents most vintage browsers from loading them at all. I do my best to help fix this so those who wish to experience the internet how it was back in the day still can.

On GitHub I like to make small contributions to various projects I find interesting; this is what the dozens of forks on my account are for. Perhaps the most notable thing to come from this is that I’ve joined the dev team of [Mario Royale Legacy](http://marioroyale.com) thanks to my frontend work.

My goals for ~~2024~~ 2025 are to learn full stack web development, game design and [Geometry Dash modding](http://geode-sdk.org).

Thanks for checking me out and have a great day :)
